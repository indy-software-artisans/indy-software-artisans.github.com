We have all enjoyed years of great meetings and awesome discussions as the Indy ALT.NET
group.

However, we felt that in order for us to grow in the direction we want, a new name was 
required. This decision was not taken lightly, and there was much debate on whether to do 
this -- and even more debate on what the new name should be. When the dust settled and the 
blood dried (figuratively speaking, of course) we had ourselves a new name:

**Indy Software Artisans**

Aside from the name change, we've also implemented a slightly different meeting style. Most, 
if not all, meetings will now consist of both a "soft" or more abstract topic as well as a 
"hard" or very techy, deep down in the code, topic. As always, everybody is free and 
encouraged to make suggestions to improve our meetings.
